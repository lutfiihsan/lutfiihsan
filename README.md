#About Me
I have over three years of experience working as a Fullstack Developer, notably with the stack
(PHP, Laravel, Javascript, MySQL). I've worked on a wide range of projects, but specialized mostly on
web base. All aspects of web development including front and back end, version
management with git. I do programming fulltime/freelance, since l'm a "career changer" I always keen to learn deep into the fundamentals of the languages and moving forward into web development with the latest technologies required to work with it. I can work in individual or team.
